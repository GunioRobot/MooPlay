MooPlay
=======


MooPlay gives some tools on top of an html5 video markup. You can build your own player with :

* a play / pause control
* buttons to move inside the video (rewind and fast forward)
* an interactive play progress slider
* a load progress bar
* a volume slider and a mute button
* subtitles loaded through an ajax request and synchronized with the video. Supported formats are SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sub)
* displays current or remaining time
* a full page display button
  
The video element methods can be called by other scripts, MooPlay objects will adapt themself to any state changes.

More functionnalities will be available.
